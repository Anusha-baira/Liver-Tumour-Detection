📌 Liver-Tumour-Detection
Liver cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project leverages Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect liver tumors from medical imaging data.

📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled liver scans, including normal and tumor-affected images. The images are preprocessed for optimal CNN performance.

🏗️ Model Architecture

Input Layer: Preprocessed liver scan images
Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction
Pooling Layers: Dimensionality reduction
Fully Connected Layers: Classification decision-making
Output Layer: Binary classification (Tumor/No Tumor)
